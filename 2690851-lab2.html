            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Ndivho Shilling, 
                a third-year student at Wits University studying Computer Science.  
                I've developed a strong foundation in programming over the last two 
                years and become proficient in Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.  
                Working on a range of projects, such as software applications and web development, 
                I've honed my abilities in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.  
                I'm excited to learn more about topics like data science, artificial intelligence, 
                and machine learning, and I'm especially curious about how these disciplines may be used to tackle challenging real-world issues.  
                I'm excited to take on increasingly challenging subjects as I work toward my degree, 
                obtain practical experience through internships, and help create cutting-edge software 
                development and cloud computing technologies.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                A website that uses AI to automatically perform EDA on the given dataset.
                This site takes in a document(excel, csv) and performs EDA on the dataset
                and provides feedback in the form of visualisations of the data as well as 
                Python code for making these visuals.
                The AI can also take in prompts so that it know what to focus on when doing the EDA.
